A script to get the transit time between two locations.  Meant to be run many times to collect
aggregate data at different times of the week.  Later it can be analyzed to determine what the best
time to leave is. Run like:

    python commute_times.py <data_file>

or if you want to switch the origin and destination:

    python commute_times.py <data_file> -switch

I have mine running through cron in the following command:

*/5 5-10 * * 1-5 <path to python> <path to data file>
